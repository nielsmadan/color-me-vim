color-me-vim
------------

These are markdown based slides that were used to give a presentation at the [Berlin Vim user group](www.vimberlin.de).
The presentation was given using Vim by sourcing the presentation.vim file, which changes the look of vim slightly
(switch off line numbers, stop cursor bllink, empty status bar, etc.) and defines some useful mappings:

* next slide: `<c-n>`
* previous slide: `<c-p>`
* execute current line in normal mode: `<c-z>`
* execute current line in command mode: `<m-z>`
* change filetype to vim: `<m-v>`
* change filetype to markdown: `<m-m>`
